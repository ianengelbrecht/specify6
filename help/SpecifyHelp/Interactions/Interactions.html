    <p>
       Interactions in Specify allow users to create and manage documentation associated
      with&nbsp;the movement of specimens or data into or outside of the collection. This includes
      information about loans, gifts, borrowed items, permits, shipments, accessions, disposals,
      deaccessions and information requests. For example, a collection manager may respond to a
      request for a loan of specimens&nbsp;for research by&nbsp;creating loan record in Specify.
      The record would include the list of specimens to be loaned, along with other required loan
      information (loan number, date of loan, due date, agents, etc.). When the loan is returned,
      the manager would then update the loan record to note the date of the return and which
      specimens were returned.

       <a name="int_accession" id="accessions"></a>Accessions
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         Accessioning is the formal process by which a specimen or object is legally accepted and
        recorded as a museum item and differs from cataloging. This usually entails proof of
        ownership (in the form of a signed deed of gift) and legal collection (in the form of all
        associated permits - collecting, import and export). Accessioning and its numbering system
        are usually a policy adopted as a museum-wide policy but is not used by all museums. An
        accession usually covers an entire field trip and multiple catalog items could be included
        within a single accession. Within the database there is a one-to-many relationship between
        Accessions and Collection Objects. Accessions can be created through the Interactions menu
        or directly from the Collection Object being entered.
      </p>
      <p>
         Note: Accession number is one of the fields that can be formatted through the schema
        localizer. The accession numbering system can also be associated at the Collection level
        for individual collection use or the Institution level where a single numbering system is
        adopted by all collections within an Institution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br>
         All associated agents and permitting information can be entered in a one-to-many
        relationship within the accession.
      </p>
      <p>
         A Deaccession, the legal process of removing items from a collection, can be associated
        with the relevant accession(s).

       <strong>Creating a Transaction</strong> <strong>Record</strong>
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         Loans, Gifts, Exchange Outs and Disposals&nbsp;document items leaving the Institution, and
        Collection Objects are linked to them through preparations.&nbsp; The first step in
        creating a record is choosing the specimens (as preparations) to add to the transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
         A Specify preference allows collections to choose whether to use collection object
        identifiers (example: Catalog Number) or preparation identifiers (example: Preparation
        Number, Bar Code), or to be asked. For more information see <a href=
        "../Prefs/Loans.html">Interactions</a> <a href="../Prefs/Loans.html">Preferences</a>.
      </p>
      <ul>

         If any record sets or Information Requests have been saved, a dialog appears prompting the
        user to either <em>Enter Items</em> or use an existing <i>Record Set or Information
        Request</i>. The Record Set option is the easiest method to use when loaning/gifting large
        numbers of Collection Objects or Preparations. The Information Request is a good way to
        document the data sent outside of the collection.
      </p>
      <p>
         Uncataloged items may also be recorded in Interactions&nbsp;(See <a href=

         When returning all of the items in a loan it is easiest to use the <em>Select</em>
        All&nbsp;button at the bottom of the Loan Retun dialog. Clicking <em>Select All</em> will
        return and resolve the loan and close the loan by&nbsp;checking the <em>Is Closed</em>
        checkbox in the loan, thereby closing the loan.&nbsp; The <em>Return Loan</em> button ont
        the form will also change to <em>All Returned</em>.&nbsp; If any of these numbers are
        altered at any stage, thereby reopening the loan, this button will revert to Return
        Loan.&nbsp; For partial returns, or when some items are resolved but not returned, due to
        loss or damage, the quantity returned and quantity resolved can be manipulated and remarks
        inserted.
      </p>
      <p>
         When returning loans, a Loan Return Prep record is created for each preparation lent
        out.&nbsp; There are three values associated with each Loan Return preparation:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
           <strong>Quantity</strong> - the quantity of each preparation lent out.
        </p>
        <p>
           <strong>Quantity Returned</strong> - the quantity of preparations returned.&nbsp; This
          may not equal the quantity sent out in cases of partial returns and/or lost/damaged
          specimens not returned (see resolved below).
        </p>
        <p>
           <strong>Quantity Resolved</strong> - used to document items that are&nbsp;resolved but
          have not been returned. This is used in the case where specimens are lost or damaged and
          are no longer associated with the collection.&nbsp; It us often helpful to use the
          remarks field to describe the circumstances of this discrepancy.&nbsp;
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
         For the loan to be closed, the quantity lent must equal the quantity resolved.&nbsp; In
        the case of a full return of a loan, all three numbers would be identical for each
        preparation.
      </p>
      <p>
         Loan Return Prep's can also be individually altered using the Loan Return Prep button <img

           <strong><em>Note:</em></strong>&nbsp; The <em>Is Closed</em> check box is editable only

         Collection managers are regularly asked to share specific data records with local or
        external researchers. In most cases this is accomplished by attaching a spreadsheet or .csv
        file to an email message. The information shared is usually in the form of Collection
        Objects. Specify 6 has an automated function to handle responses to specimen information
        requests and record these for later retrieval and reporting.
      </p>
      <p>
         Interactions such as Loans, Gifts, Exchange Outs and Disposals can also be created using
        Information Requests.

         Click <i><b>Information Request</b></i> in the side bar to start the process.

         If any record sets have been saved, a dialog appears prompting the user to either Enter
        Catalog Numbers or use an existing record set.&nbsp; The Record Set method would be easiest
        when using large sets of data.

        button has been clicked.&nbsp; The attached Collection Objects will appear in the main
        portion of the email and will also be attached as a CSV file.
      </p>

         Unlike queries, Information Requests are only saved on the side bar and not in the

        kept in the database of an Information Request once it has been deleted.

         The Exchange In table is similar to the borrow table in recording incoming material and

        be a destructive sample, item lost in transport, the item was disposed, or simply no longer

      <p>
         Deaccessions in Specify are the opposite of an Accession i.e. the legal process of
        relinquishing possession of a specimen through removal from the collection. For this reason
        Deaccessions can not be created without a specimen first being associated with the
        relevant&nbsp;transaction - Gift, Exchange Out or Disposal. Deaccessions can be queried and
        viewed, but the creation of a Deaccession can only be accomplished from a Gift, Exchange
        Out or Disposal form as shown below.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
         A repository agreement is similar to an accession but does not transfer ownership of the
        specimens. This is most frequently entered into with countries that do not wish to lose
        claim to their biodiversity but will allow museums to house their specimens and, in some
        cases, is the only method of legally collecting in some countries. Repository agreements
        can entail multiple accessions i.e. multiple field trips, and thus there is a one-to-many
        relationship in the database between repository agreements and accessions and a method for
        linking many accessions to a single repository agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
         Much like an accession, all associated agents and permitting information can be entered in
        a one-to-many relationship within the repository agreement.
