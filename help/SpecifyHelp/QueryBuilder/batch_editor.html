    </h2>
    <p>
       NEW in the 6 offers the ability to edit a 'batch' of data using an interface very similar to
      the Specify WorkBench. Batch Editing is a powerful method to improve data quality -- it can
      potentially change thousands of data records with just a few mouse clicks. Once edits are
      made and confirmed, changes will be permanent and they cannot be rolled back. We
      enthusiastically recommend you take the following precautions before a Batch Edit session:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make a fresh, full backup of your database.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ensure that you understand the relationships represented by the fields and tables you wish
        to change before using the Batch Editor.
      </li>
      <li>
        When creating queries to choose the data that will be displayed in the Batch Editor, create
        the query from the primary table, and&nbsp;include fields and tables related to the
        specific data you wish to edit.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once a batch edit has been completed, it is a good idea to view updated results of your
        query to confirm that the changes made to the data did not have unintended consequences in
        related fields and tables.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is best, when possible, not to edit multiple fields from multiple tables during a single
        Batch Editing session, but to limit the edits to fields within in a single table.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
       Additional notes regarding the Batch Editor:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Only 7000 records that can be edited at one time. If you wish to edit more data you will
        need to split your data into batches of 7000 and edit each batch seperately. It may be
        useful to first split your data into saved Record Sets prior to starting the Batch Edit
        process.
      </li>
      <li>
        Batch editing is only available to users with an&nbsp;<em>Admin, Manager,</em> or <i>Full
        Access</i> user&nbsp;status who also have access to both the Query Builder and WorkBench
        tools.
      </li>
      <li>
        In this release,&nbsp;Taxonomy, Stratigraphy and Lithostratigraphy&nbsp;tree-structured
        information can only be viewed, and not edited&nbsp;in the Batch Editor tool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fields that are read-only in the schema, such as unique identifiers (such as GUID or
        Catalog Number), formatted or aggregated can only be viewed, and not edited&nbsp;in the
        Batch Editor tool.
      </li>
      <li>
        When deleting values in Geography and Locality tree fields only fields without child data
        can be deleted, one can delete children in tree fields as long as there are no child
        records.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you bring data into the Batch Editor, you are essentially 'checking it out' from the
        database so that you may make changes that will later be validated and applied. If, by
        chance,&nbsp;other users are also accessing and editing the same data records, this can
        result in&nbsp;a different version of data in the database when your Batch Editing session
        is attempting to validate them. In this instance Specify will not commit the change and
        will alert you to this action in a dialog window.
      </li>
      <li>
        When more than one collection resides in a single database changes made in any of the
        shared tables will affect other collections. For instance, Locality information is shared
        at the Discipline level; therefore, changes made to Locality records used in more than one
        collection and changed in a single collection will reflected in all other collections
        within the same Discipline in the database.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       The following documentation for the Batch Editor is intended as a basic overview. To better
      explain the changes that will be made to records in related tables&nbsp;when using the Batch
      Editing tool the Project has&nbsp;created a video which demonstrates these changes using real
      workflows. That video can be found on the Specify Collections Consortium&nbsp;website:<a

       <a name="choose_data"></a><u>Choosing the Data to Edit</u>
    </p>
    <p>
       Open the Batch Editing tool by clicking the <img alt="batch edit" src=
      "../images/batch_editing_24x24.png">&nbsp;(Batch Edit) button on the Task Bar (at the top of
      the Specify screen).
    </p>

    <p>
       &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       To use the Batch Editor you must first choose the records you wish to edit. The side bar
      offers helpful options to get started:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Create a new query by clicking the appropriate table in the <em>Create Query</em> section
        of the side bar.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         The <em>Create Query</em> section of the side bar lists the tables that are available to
        batch edit.
      </p>
      <p>
         Start by clicking the table that contains the data you wish to edit.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Open a saved query by clicking the appropriate query in the <em>Saved Queries</em> section
        of the side bar.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         If there is&nbsp;an existing query that will include the data you wish to batch edit
        choose it from the side bar.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Choose a record set in the <em>Record Set</em> section of the side bar.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         If there is a&nbsp;saved Record Set that you wish to batch edit from the query used to
        create it, or another saved query, right-mouse click on the record set and choose <em>View
        with Saved Query</em> from the pop-up dialog.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
       <em><strong>Note:</strong></em> When doing Batch Edits from a&nbsp;Collection Object query,
      Specify basically 'flattens' the data when bringing it into the batch editor. Therefore,
      changes made to fields in the batch editor will only affect that single Collection Object
      record. However, when creating queries from one of the other tables, the changes made will be
      reflected in all related records. The Batch Editing video explains this in more detail:<a
      href=
      "http://www.sustain.specifysoftware.org/support/helpcasts/">&nbsp;sustain.specifysoftware.org/support/helpcasts</a>

    </p>
    <p>
       &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       If you chose to create a query or open a saved query, you will notice that the Query Builder
      interface is displayed. Choose the tables and fields you wish to edit. Also, include related
      data that will allow you to determine the uniqueness of the records you are editing. For help
      using the Query Builder please <a href="Query_Builder.html">Click Here.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       Once you have completed your query you may wish to save it by clicking the <em>Save</em>
      button at the bottom of the Workspace and naming your query. This is useful when editing
      large sets of data that require multiple Batch Editing instances.
    </p>
    <p>
       Otherwise, click the <em>Search</em> button at the bottom of the Workspace to display your
      query results. The data you see in the Query Results screen is the exact data that will be
      displayed in the Batch Editor.

    </p>
    <p>
       Once you are satisfied that you have successfully chosen the data you wish to edit you can
      either bring all the data or a subset of the data into the Batch Editor.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Click the <img alt="batch edit" src="../images/batch_editing_24x24.png">(Batch Edit) button
        located at the top-right corner of the Search Results bar&nbsp;to display all the data into
        the Batch Editor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Limit the data by either clicking each record while holding down the <em>Ctrl</em> key, or
        clicking on a record and dragging your mouse to select multiple records. Then, click the
        <img src="../images/batch_editing_24x24.png">&nbsp;(Batch Edit) button located at the
        top-right corner of the Search Results bar.
      </li>

       Your data are now available to manipulate in the Batch Editor tool. The Batch Editor
      interface is similar to the WorkBench, with the same features for manipulating data, such as;
      copy, past, sort, fill up, fill down, etc. For more information about the tools available
      please <a href="../Workbench/GridEditing.html">Click Here.</a>

       <em><strong>Note:</strong></em> When deleting terms in the Batch Editor ensure that there
      are no spaces in the field.

    </p>
    <p>
       <u>Data Validation Panel</u>
    </p>
    <p>
       The Batch Editor also includes a Data Validation panel at the lower-left corner&nbsp;of the
      Workspace. Fields containing invalid data are highlighted in red and fields containing edited
      data are highlighted in green. The panel also displays a count of the fields affected in both
      categories. The adjacent triangles can be used to find the next affected data field.
    </p>
    <p>
       <em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Changes made in the Batch Editor cannot be applied when
      invalid data are entered.
    </p>
    <p>
       <em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Not all fields are available for editing in the Batch
      Editor. Columns of non-editable fields are grayed out.
    </p>
    <p>
       &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       If at any time during editing you wish to revert back to the original data, click the
      <em>Undo All</em> button located at the lower-right corner&nbsp;of the Workspace screen.
    </p>
    <p>
       Once you have finished editing your data and are ready to commit your changes, click the
      <em>Apply</em> button located at the bottom-right of the Workspace screen.

    </p>
    <p>
       Specify will now validate your data, and display statistics about the changes you are about
      to make, but the Batch Editor has not committed those changes to the database.&nbsp;If
      necessary, you can click the <em>Cancel</em> button without losing your edits.
    </p>
    <p>
       The Batch Progress dialog will display both alerts regarding the&nbsp;progress in validating
      the edits&nbsp;and results of the changes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Applying your edits is a progress statement.
      </li>
      <li>
        Validating changes to the database is a progress statement.
      </li>
      <li>
        Number of edits successfully applied and validated will display once the process is
        complete.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         Typically the status&nbsp;will state that all edits were successfully applied; however, if
        a concurrent user edited one of the records while you were batch editing, Specify will
        recognize this and skip those records. If you wish to verify this with a co-worker you can
        click the <em>Cancel</em> button at the bottom of the dialog to cancel the process. The
        Batch Editor will still be displayed with all your previous changes and you can apply the
        changes again when you are ready.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Number of Collection Objects affected by your changes
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         This message displays the total number of records that will be updated in each table that
        is affected by the batch edit. It is meant to help you understand the relationships
        to&nbsp;tables that are affected by your changes. If these numbers do not reflect the
        changes you believe you made we recommend that you cancel the update to discover the
        reason. It may be useful&nbsp;to select only a few records to load into the batch editor,
        make your edits, and then apply them in the Batch Editor. Once that is complete you can
        create queries on those changed records that allow you to better understand how the edits
        you made have affected related fields and tables, and whether you wish to proceed in making
        those changes to all your records.

      <li>
        Whether your changes were saved or canceled.

    </ul>
    <p>
       A timer also appears on the Batch Process dialog, allowing you 180 seconds&nbsp;to either
      commit or cancel your changes. When you bring data into the Batch Editor, you are essentially
      'checking it out' from the database so that you may make changes that will later be validated
      and applied. If other users are also accessing and editing the same data, it can result
      in&nbsp;a different version of data in the database than when the data was originally checked
      out. In this instance Specify will not commit the change and will alert you to this action in
      the status dialog.

    <p>
       <u>Batch Edited Record Sets</u>
    </p>
    <p>
       Upon completion of a Batch Edit the records are saved in a new Record Set. If you saved the
      original query used to define the data you edited, then the resulting Record Set will use the
      same name as the query. If you did not save the query the Record Set will be saved
      with&nbsp;the name of the table used to create the query followed by a number that increments
      by 1 each time that the query was used for a Batch Edit. For example, if you created a
      Collecting Event query but did not save it, the ensuing Record Set would be named: New
      Collecting Event Query 1. You do not need to save these Record Sets, they are only meant to
      give you an opportunity to see the edited records at a later time. You may find it convenient
      to rename the record sets with the name or objective of the Batch or perhaps the date.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        View the changed records in the Record Set in Specify's data forms by left-clicking on the
        Record Set name in the sidebar.
      </li>
      <li>
        View the records in the Record Set in a spreadsheet format by right-clicking the Record Set
        name&nbsp;in the side bar and then choosing <em>View with saved Query</em> in the pop-up
        dialog.
