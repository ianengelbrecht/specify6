    </h2>
    <p>
       When Specify is launched it automatically checks for updates and allows the user to choose
      to download and install the update, then provides a login mechanism.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a name="specify_login" id="specify_login"></a>Types of Specify Logins
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         Application security for Specify 6 has a few layers. First, Specify uses a "Master"
        account (username and password), which is the only account with access permission to the
        underlying database manager (MySQL or MariaDB). Second, Specify uses specific User account
        credentials (username and password), that enables individual access to the Specify
        application. Specify uses only one Master username and password for all users, but encrypts
        the Master password with the User credential information, creating an encrypted string, or
        key. This allows the Master account information to be encrypted and uniquefor each user
        account.
      </p>
      <p>
         Some setup and database administration tasks in Specify, such as creating new Disciplines
        or Divisions, require a third password, what is referred to as the "IT User" or "IT"
        password. The IT account and password is used to login directly to the underlying database
        manager (MySQL or MariaDB). The account has full administrator privileges within the
        database manager and is typically referred to as a 'root' account, and was
        created&nbsp;when the database manager was originally installed. When a database
        administrator makes changes to the Specify database schema, the Specify "IT Account"
        enables root-level access to the MySQL or MariaDB data manager. IT user account credentials
        are required whenever there is a published update to Specify that modifies or extends the
        underlying database structure (schema) of the database. Not all updates modify the database
        schema but many do and the IT user account credentials are required in those cases.
      </p>
      <p>
         In review, there are four (4) different types of credentials in Specify:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          User username and User password
        </li>
        <li>
          Master username and Master password
        </li>
        <li>
          Master Key, (Encrypted username / password )
        </li>
        <li>
          IT username and IT password (used to gain access to the MySQL database manager)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>
       Starting Specify for the First Time
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         The very first time a user is required to login to Specify they will need to know their
        User username and password as well as their Encryption Key. An Encryption Key can be
        created from within the Login tool; however, it requires that the user know the Master
        username and password to create a new key.
      </p>
      <p>
         The User credentials are stored on the user's machine. This allows the Login tool to
        automatically fill in the Username and Encryption Key for previous users. When opening
        Specify the username will be pre-filled with the username last user to open Specify.
      </p>
      <p>
         If you are accessing Specify on a new computer you will be required to fill in your User
        username and password as well as a valid Encryption Key, just as you did when logging into
        Specify for the first time.
      </p>

         Users with an existing <strong>Username</strong> and <strong>Password</strong> can simply
        login using the correct fields.
      </p>
      <p>
         Users that are logging in for the first time, or wish to login to a different database
        than they were previously using must click the<img src=

         When the Specify database is created using the Specify Wizard the
        <strong><em>Database</em></strong> and <strong><em>Server</em></strong> information should
        be included in the dialog. If the database and server information is not included in the
        dialog you may type them into the drop-down menu box. If you do not know the name of your
        database or server and you are running Specify on a local machine please consult your IT
        administrator. If more than one database and server are available the dialog will list all
        the choices for both.
      </p>
      <p>
         If you are accessing a remote server, you will need to fill in the Database and Server
        name (this can be an IP address if the IP is 'Static').
      </p>
      <p>
         Users wishing to configure their server and firewall to use a <strong>Port</strong> other
        than the default (3306) port may do so and type the new port number into the box provided.
        If your port has not been reconfigured for a specific port the default port is 3306.

         The Master Source information refers to the location that the encryption is stored. At

        choose <em>Encryption key stored in local preferences.</em>

         <strong><em>Encrypted Username / Password</em></strong> refers to the Encryption Key, or
        string that results when the Master username and password are Encrypted using the User
        username and password. This can be created by the IT administrator when a new user is
        created in the Specify application and then given to the user, or it can be created by
        clicking the <em>Generate Master</em> ... button.
