    </h2>
    <p>
       Over 300 years of global botanical and zoological exploration have produced over a billion
      biological specimens in museums worldwide that document the identity and distribution of life
      on Earth. Advances in data networking and computing technologies have transformed the way
      research collections digitize, process, and publish information about those specimens. But we
      are still evolving new ways to utilize the communication, computational, and integration
      power of the information technologies and networks. The goal of Specify 6 is to support both
      ongoing curatorial and data publishing workflows, but also to extend collections computing
      with capabilities for integration and synthesis, within and across science data communities
      to enable collections researchers and their institutions to leverage that monumental 300+
      year investment in species discovery and biotic inventory for the benefit of science and
      society.
    </p>
    <p>
       Specify 6 is a database platform produced by the Specify Collections Consortium, a
      non-profit, open source, membership organization established in 2018 by museums around the
      globe. The Consortium aims to innovate, deploy, and support software tools and services to
      support collections computing for its member institutions. The Consortium's web site is
      located at: www.specifysoftware.org.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
         Auto-updates are an automatic software update delivery service built into Specify. It
        delivers and installs the latest Specify releases automatically to registered installations
        over the Internet. When Specify is started, the program checks with a Project server to see
        if there are any updates available and if there are, the user is offered the opportunity to
        download the update software and install it within Specify. Specify software updates can
        also be manually obtained at anytime through the 'Check for Updates' option on the Help
        menu. The online update service will update versions of Specify compiled by the University
        of Kansas.
      </p>
      <p>
         Users with computers that do not have internet access should turn off the 'Check for
        Updates' function in the System section of User Preferences. For help performing this task
        visit the <a href="../Prefs/System.html">System Preference</a> help page.

    </h3>
    <p>
       The Specify Help system can be opened from anywhere in the application by typing the
      <em>F1</em> key, or <em>function</em> + <em>F1</em> keys. The help system was designed to
      provide an overview of the modules within Specify as well as a guide for a given task. This
      is referred to as context-sensitive help. When performing a given task in the application,
      type F1 and Specify Help will open to the corresponding documentation page. In the same
      sense, Specify Help is best read while viewing and using the corresponding module in the
      application. A Table of Contents is also provided. Specify Help was written in Java Help and
      includes full-text search capabilities by clicking on the <img src=
      "../../images/help_search_button.png" alt="help" height="21" width="44">&nbsp;(search)
      button.<br>
